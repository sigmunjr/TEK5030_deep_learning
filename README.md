# TEK5030_deep_learning
This week we have 3 exercises. They each have a [python notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a set of instructions and code you can run. They are ment to be run in [colab](http://colab.research.google.com). There you have access to a powerfull GPU, and you don't need any additional setup. You do need Google account to run the notebooks in colab.

(not recommended) Alternatively you could use https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks to run the notebooks, or you can [install and run jupyter notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46) on your own machine.

## Exercise 1: Simple Convolutional Neural network (CNN)
